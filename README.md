## What and Why?  
**PocketBudget** is a mobile web application for logging and visualizing daily expenses with **account-based isolation**. Unlike most finance apps that require online sync, ads, or subscriptions, PocketBudget is **local-first, private, and lightweight**.  

Why this matters:  
- Many students and young professionals just want a simple, distraction-free tool to track spending.  
- Existing apps are bloated, overly complex, or not privacy-friendly.  
- On shared devices, account isolation ensures no one else can see your data.

## For Whom?  
PocketBudget is designed for:  
- **Students and early-career professionals** who want to manage personal spending.  
- **Privacy-conscious users** who prefer offline tools.  
- **Shared device users** who need separate, secure accounts.

### ðŸ“– Example Scenario  
- Alice, a student, registers with username **alice123** and a PIN.  
- On Monday, she buys coffee for $4.50 and logs it under **Food & Drink**.  
- At lunch, she quickly adds a $10 meal with just two taps.  
- By Friday, the **Summary Page** shows she has already spent $60 on food.  
- She sets her **Monthly Budget** to $250 for food and receives a soft warning when her spending reaches $200.  
- On her roommateâ€™s tablet, Alice logs in with her own credentials â€” her data remains private and separate.
